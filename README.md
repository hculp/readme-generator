  ## Description

  This is README.md file generator for use on coding projects. It is a command  line based utility that prompts the user for information about the title, description, table of contents, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests, and thier GitHub username and email for questions. User input is then used to generate each associated section of the README.md file. When a user selects a license from the list of options, then a badge is created by the top of the README.md with the selected license. The table of contents also links to the matching section so that README is quick to navigate.
